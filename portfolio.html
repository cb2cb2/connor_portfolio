<h1><p> SCRATCH PROJECT</p></h1>

<p> Link to my Mini Game Maze on Scratch</p>
</a>
<p><font color="black"> This project was about creating a game with the help of my partner Ryan Van Earden.  Throughout this project, I used multiple algorithms to enhance sprites and make the coding a bit simpler.  Our game is about controlling a character to get through mazes and beating minigames along the way in order to beat the game.  My coding uses algorithms to operate the sprites, including movement, transportation, and making them disappear by changing to another screen.  During this project, I have learned new programming techniques including how to change a sprite's motion when a certain situation is true.  I loved programming the game and mini games with the enhancement of code and motion of sprites.

<p><font color="black"> This project was made with my partner Austin, and it was about how to use MIT App Inventor.  We created the quiz function game called Quizucation. The function fo the quiz is to test basic knowledge of individuals to let them know if they have basic intuition of certain topics.  We used blocks of different types of functions to transition form each page and to determine if an individuals guess was correct.  We used images and text boxes to filter in the details and attraction of the project in order for the contestant to read and answer each question.  I have learned after this project how to properly use App Inventor and the coding blocks in order to have the project function properly.</font></p>

<h1><p> PYTHON PROJECT</p></h1>

<img src="images/Image Artist Code.png" height="400">
<p><font color="black"> The image artist project was completed by my partner, Bradley, and myself.  This project allowed to us to take one image and transform it into an edited version of that image.  For programming and coding, we wrote in the language Python.  We first selected an image which was an artistic drawing of Jose Altuve, and decided to first change the colored spots of the image.  This was completed by using RGB variables which converted the original colored spots from orange to blue.  Next, we decided to change the positioning of the leg in the bottom right corner to move left and down based off of the original image.  We accomplished this by first choosing the size of the cropped piece, and decided to paste it by giving it coordinates to follow.  Finally, we wrote the function "im.show()" in order to display the enhanced image.  The last line of the coding that was written saves the new image into the folder "Altuve_Engstrom.JPG.</p>

<p><font color="black"> This project was made with my partner Alex and I and we created a analysis graph and page to represent crimes ny different races in America.  The purpose of this project was to inform citizens about which races were most targeted and caught with committing a crime. Doing this project has made me realize that targeting and biased opinions are never to be thought of as true because the races that citizens believe that commit the most crimes are indeed false.  Hopefully, this program will inform them and cause them to rethink what they say and who they target before its too late. From this project I have learned how to program and code in order to construct a graph representing the percentages of crimes committed by different races.</font></p>

<p><font color="black"> This project is about Shelly the robotic turtle and how it is relevant to big data.  Shelly is a robotic turtle that helps kids learn the consequences of abuse.  It does so by touch, if handled with care Shelly is fun to play with but if not, Shelly hides in its shell for 14 seconds.
