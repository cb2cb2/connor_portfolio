<p> <font color="white"><font size="6.5"> My name is Connor Burns and I am a sophomore at Don Antonio Lugo High School in Chino, California.
<br>I love to play baseball and I play with the West Coast Blackdogs.
<br>Every year I play a USA baseball tournament in Phoenix, Arizona on the MLB spring training fields.  I would love to play in college at either Cal State Fullerton or UC San Diego, as well as to continue my education.  I hope to one day play in thye MLB and make it in The Hall of Fame. </p>
